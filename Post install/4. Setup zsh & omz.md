- run `zsh` in terminal as it was already added on the install step. Just create a `.zshrc` file
- install `omz` and set `zsh` as default shell:
```bash
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```

- install `zsh` plugins and enable them:
  1. [zsh-autosuggestions](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions)
  2. [zsh-syntax-highlighting](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting)
  3. [zsh-autocomplete](https://github.com/marlonrichert/zsh-autocomplete)
  4. [zsh-history-substring-search](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-history-substring-search)
     
```
plugins=(git zsh-autosuggestions zsh-syntax-highlighting zsh-autocomplete zsh-history-substring-search z)
